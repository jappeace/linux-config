This project contains config files so that they're backuped and can be shared
across multiple devices.
At the moment It's made shareable by heavily [relying on nix](https://nixos.org/).
Per machine I maintain a seperate branch.
Feel free to contact me on discord if you have issues/questions when using any of these configs for your own:
